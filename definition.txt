Builder

Motivation: Delegate instance creation to another class

Problem: Supporting a big number of combinations of constructor parameters

Solution: Move creation responsibility to another class
    Setters with result

Pros:
    Create complex object step-by-step
    Use same code to created different combinations
    Isolate creation logic from other business logic
    Supports OOP concept of object being fully initialized
        before accessing it

Cons:
    Code ae grows due to new classes
    Appear dependencies to Builders
    No compilation time checks of potential violations
    Work bad with big hierarchies of classes
