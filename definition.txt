Factory

Motivation: Virtualize object creation
    One place/function/class to create instances
    Generic code
    One of the decoupling patterns

Problem: Constructors are not virtual
    Switch instruction is not flexible

Solution
    Inheritance + generation functions
    Limit solution to one only "switch"
