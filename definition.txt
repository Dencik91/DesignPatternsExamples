Observer

Motivation: Allow to notify multiple objects interested to know
    about any changes (one-to-many dependency)

Problem: Active checking vs Updates
    Classes coupling

Solution:
    Class Subject - on update, notifies every registered observer
    Interface observer
    Concrete Observer implements Observer
